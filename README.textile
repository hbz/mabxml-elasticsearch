h1. About

Index MAB-XML into "Elasticsearch":https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch using "Metafacture":https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-documentation an serve it with "Playframework":https://www.playframework.com/.

h1. Build

"!https://secure.travis-ci.org/hbz/mabxml-elasticsearch.png?branch=master!":https://travis-ci.org/hbz/mabxml-elasticsearch

Prerequisites: Maven 3 with Java 8 and UTF-8 encoding; verify with @mvn -version@

Create and change into a folder where you want to store the projects:

* @mkdir ~/git ; cd ~/git@

Build the hbz metafacture-core fork:

* @git clone https://github.com/hbz/metafacture-core.git@
* @cd metafacture-core@
* @mvn clean install -DskipTests@
* @cd ..@

Build mabxml-elasticsearch:

* @git clone https://github.com/hbz/mabxml-elasticsearch.git@
* @cd mabxml-elasticsearch@
* @mvn clean install@

See the @.travis.yml@ file for details on the CI config used by Travis.

h2. Index server

See also: "Elasticsearch installation steps":https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch.

Download the latest 1.3.x Elasticsearch release, e.g. on Linux:

@wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.3.9.zip@

Unzip it and change into the new directory:

@unzip elasticsearch-1.3.9.zip ; cd elasticsearch-1.3.9@

Run the @elasticsearch@ application in the @bin/@ folder in daemon mode (output is logged to @logs/elasticsearch.log@), and record the process id:

@bin/elasticsearch -d -p pid@

Access your local Elasticsearch server:

@curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/@

To shut down the Elasticsearch server, kill the process recorded in the @pid@ file on startup:

@kill `cat pid`@

To continue with the usage section below, leave the server running or restart it, and change back to the project root directory:

@cd ..@

h2. Transformation

To transform and index the data, run the Transform.java class and pass arguments using your IDE or Maven. Pass a directory with the data to transform and the file suffix:

@src/main/resources/input/ bz2@

Also pass your Elasticsearch cluster name, node IP number, and index name:

@elasticsearch 127.0.0.1 hbz01@

To try this, first get some sample data and return to the root directory:

@cd src/main/resources/input/ ; wget http://test.lobid.org/assets/data/20140817_20140818.tar.bz2 ; cd -@

Then run the configured Transformation using Maven:

@mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="flow.Transform" -Dexec.args="src/main/resources/input/ bz2 elasticsearch 127.0.0.1 hbz01"@

This will index the data from the specified location to the cluster 'elasticsearch', using node '127.0.0.1', into an index called 'hbz01'.

You can then GET a specific record by hbz ID:

@curl -XGET 'http://127.0.0.1:9200/hbz01/mabxml/HT012786619'; echo@

You can also exclude the Elasticsearch metadata:

@curl -XGET 'http://127.0.0.1:9200/hbz01/mabxml/HT012786619/_source'; echo@

For details on the various options see the "GET API documentation":http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-get.html.

h2. Web server

Change into the @web/@ directory:

@cd web@

Download the minimal activator application (optionally, there's an offline version available, see "Playframework downloads":https://www.playframework.com/download documentation) to run the Play server:

@wget https://downloads.typesafe.com/typesafe-activator/1.3.9/typesafe-activator-1.3.9-minimal.zip@

Unzip it:

@unzip typesafe-activator-1.3.9-minimal.zip@

Start the Play server from the @web/@ project root in background production mode (output is logged to console and @logs/application.log@, for development mode replace @start@ with @run@):

@activator-1.3.9-minimal/bin/activator start@

The web applications index page can now be accessed at "http://localhost:9000/hbz01":http://localhost:9000/hbz01.

Press @Ctrl+D@ to return to the shell (since we called @start@, the server remains in background).

GET data by ID using the Play server:

@curl http://localhost:9000/hbz01/HT017665866@

Unlike the Elasticsearch index queries above (which serve JSON), this serves XML:

@curl http://localhost:9000/hbz01/HT017665866 | xmllint --format -@

To shut down the server, kill the process recorded in the @RUNNING_PID@ file:

@kill `cat target/universal/stage/RUNNING_PID`@

When running in foreground development mode (@activator run@), hitting @CTRL+D@ stops the server.

h1. Deployment

We run this transformation daily using a cron job that calls the @src/main/resources/transform.sh@ script. Internal documentation: to fully understand _what_ is done _when_, trace the entries in crontab of _hduser@weywot1_.

The final index data is served at "http://lobid.org/hbz01":http://lobid.org/hbz01, with individual resource URLs like "http://lobid.org/hbz01/HT012786619":http://lobid.org/hbz01/HT012786619. Internal documentation: the application is deployed at _sol@quaoar1:~/git/mabxml-elasticsearch_, an Apache proxy is set up at _emphytos:/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/lobid.org.conf_.
